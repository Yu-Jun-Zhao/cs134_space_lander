![game screenshot](bin/data/screenshot.png)

## Introduction
A 3d simulation game. The goal of this application is to simulate the motion of the lunar lander.  

## Concepts
Basic Physics Engine: Uses kinematic physics.

Octree for collision detection and mouse-ray detection.

Particle System for simulating the thruster flame.

## Controls
To Switch Cameras:
   
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F1 - Main Cam <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F2 - Front Cam <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F3 - Bottom Cam <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F4 - Track Cam
  
Two different ways to control the spacecraft:
  * Arrow Key:
  
  * Mouse Click:

The terrain models and the lander model are provided by my CS134 professor. In other words, I did not create the models.
In addition, I do not own the sound file and the TrueType font file.
