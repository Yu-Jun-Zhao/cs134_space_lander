# CS134 SPACE LANDER PROJECT

![game screenshot](bin/data/screenshot.png)

## Introduction
A 3d simulation game. The goal of this application is to simulate the motion of the lunar lander.  

## Concepts
Basic Physics Engine: Uses kinematic physics.

Octree for collision detection and mouse-ray detection.

Particle System for simulating the thruster flame.

## Controls
To Switch Cameras:
   
     F1 - Main Cam <br />
     F2 - Front Cam <br />
     F3 - Bottom Cam <br />
     F4 - Track Cam
  
Two different ways to control the spacecraft:
  * Arrow Key: 
  
          Up for +y <br />
          Down for -y <br />
          Left for -x <br />
          Right for +x <br />
          Ctrl + Up for +z <br />
          Ctrl + Down for -z <br />
   
  * Mouse Click:

The terrain models and the lander model are provided by my CS134 professor. In other words, I did not create the models.
In addition, I do not own the sound file and the TrueType font file.
